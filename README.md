# Experiments with Contention Adapting Search Trees

This repository contains source code for the final project in the course CS 798.

## Running the benchmark

To run the base experiment, build the project and run the `benchmark` executable. 

## Experimental data

The files in the `bash_scripts` directory are used to automate running the benchmark for experimental runs.

## Creating graphs

The python script `graph.py` found in the `data` folder graphs the data in the .csv files generated by the bash scripts.
Before running the python script, place the results_*.csv files into the `data` folder. The script will generate two
.png files, each containing a graph that plots the throughput of the CA Tree with various thread counts.
